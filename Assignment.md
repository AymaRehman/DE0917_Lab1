# Pythonic Arithmetic Parser in C  
  
## Goal
  
Write a C program that evaluates arithmetic expressions from text files using (mostly) Python’s operator rules and standard C (similar to Java) arithmetic semantics. The program must:  
* Read an input file (or a directory of files).  
* Parse and evaluate expressions.  
* Report either the numeric result or a precise error location.  
* Write the result to an output file with a specific naming convention.
  
## CLI & I/O
  
### Invocation   
  
`calc [-d DIR | --dir DIR] [-o OUTDIR | --output-dir OUTDIR] input.txt`  
* If ` -d/--dir ` is provided, process all ` *.txt files ` in DIR (ignore subfolders).  
* If ` -o/--output-dir ` is omitted, create a default output folder:  
` <input_base>_<username>_<studentid> `  
  Example: ` labs_valdis_12345/ `  
* If ` -o/--output-dir ` is provided and does not exist, create it.  
  
### Output file name
  
For each input `task1.txt`, produce:  
`task1_<name>_<lastname>_<studentid>.txt`  
The file contains either the result (single line) or `ERROR:<pos>.`  
> Character position is 1-based, counting every char in the file, including `\n` as one character.  
  
### Input Assumptions (Baseline)
  
* ASCII only.  
* Whitespace may appear anywhere.  
* At minimum (grade 4–6) inputs are single line ≤ 100 chars (later grades extend this).  
* Expressions can be integer and, for higher grades, float (IEEE 754 double).  
  
## Features by Grade (Rubric)  
  
### Grade 4/10 — Minimal Pass  
  
* Single line (≤ 100 chars).  
* Integers only (base-10, optional leading `+`/`-`).  
* Operators: `+` `-` (binary).  
* Output: numeric result (as integer text).  
* On any parse/eval error: `ERROR:<pos>` (1-based char index).  
    
### Grade 5/10 — Positioned Errors  
  
* Same as Grade 4 plus:  
* Accurate error position: if the first error is at character 57, output `ERROR:57`.   
  * Examples of errors: invalid token, unexpected end, two operators in a row, leading operator without operand, etc.
