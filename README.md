## Aim of the Assignment

Write a C program that evaluates arithmetic expressions from text files using Python-like operator rules and standard C arithmetic semantics. It should read input files (or directories), parse and evaluate expressions, report results or error locations, and save outputs using a defined naming convention.  

## The parser supports:

- Integers and floating-point numbers (double)  
- Operators: +, -, *, /, and exponentiation **  
- Parentheses for grouping expressions ( ... )  
- Multiple lines in input files (up to 10,000 characters)  
- Error reporting with precise 1-based character positions  
- Batch processing of multiple .txt files in a folder  
- Comment lines starting with # (ignored during parsing)  
- Custom output directory with default fallback
